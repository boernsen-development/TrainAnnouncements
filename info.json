    "description": "Prints and/or plays announcements when sitting in a train. Currently the following announcements are supported:\n- approaching a station\n- train enters \"No path\"\n\nNote that the announcement sounds are static and configurable, but there is NO automatic text-to-speech. Textual announcements however print the actual station names.\n\nIf you only play single player / locally, you can add your own announcement sounds (e.g. from a recording or any free text-to-speech service such as https://freetts.com) by adding them as *.ogg file to the corresponding sub-folder and then run the script update_sounds.sh. This makes them available in the corresponding mod setting dropdowns. After updating the sounds, you might need to disable the mod, restart and then re-enable the mod if Factorio complains about missing mod settings. BE WARNED that if you added custom sounds, they will be removed once the mod is updated, so make sure to backup them before updating!"
